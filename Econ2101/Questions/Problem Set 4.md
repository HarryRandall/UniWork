## Question 1

Samira has preferences over quantities of food $x_F$ and entertainment $x_E$,
$u(x_F, x_E) = A(x_F + 5)(x_E + 10)$
where $A$ is a positive number.

### (a)
1. Find the marginal utilities of food and entertainment, $mu_F$ and $mu_E$ respectively, at all bundles $(x_F, x_E)$. Explain.

2. Give a formula for the total change in Samira’s utility, $\Delta u$, when consumption of food and entertainment change by $\Delta x_F$ and $\Delta x_E$ respectively, from the bundle $(x_F, x_E)$. Explain all steps in your working. Use your answer (to this part of this question) to derive Samira’s marginal rate of substitution with food on the horizontal axis. Give a verbal explanation.

3. Find Samira’s indifference curve through the point $(40, 30)$. If Samira is consuming this bundle, would she be willing to trade 20 units of food in order to receive 30 units of entertainment? Explain with reference to her MRS and a graph.

4. Find all quantities of entertainment that Samira would be willing to trade for 20 units of food. Explain your working.

## Question 2

### (I)
Organize the following list of utility functions into categories based on whether they represent the same preferences:

1. $\sqrt{x_1 x_2}$
2. $\sqrt{x_1} + x_2$
3. $\ln(x_1 x_2)$
4. $\ln(x_1) + \ln(x_2)$
5. $x_1 + x_2 + 5$
6. $\sqrt{x_1 x_2} + \sin(x_1 x_2) + x_1 x_2$
7. $x_1 x_2$

### (II)
1. Draw accurate graphs of an indifference curve passing through a bundle with both quantities non-zero for each set of preferences given by each of the utility functions above.
2. Which, if any, of the classes of preferences are homothetic? Explain.

## Question 3

Your preferences over good 1 with quantity $x_1$ and good 2 with quantity $x_2$ are given by $u(x_1, x_2) = 2x_1 + \ln(x_2)$.

### (a)
What is your marginal rate of substitution function? Explain.

### (b)
What is your optimal consumption bundle when the price of good 1 is 10, the price of good 2 is 12, and income is 60? What if your income doubles? Show your answer in a diagram, illustrating your income expansion path.

### (c)
Now suppose that the price of good 1 is 50, the price of good 2 is 20, and income is only 20. Show the income expansion path in this setting.
