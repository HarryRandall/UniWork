**All Questions Equal Marks**

*State whether you agree or disagree with the following statement (separately) and **explain why**, concisely, with reference to an example, diagram or a result or proof if necessary. Your explanation is crucial for receiving full marks.*

**(Q1)** A consumer faces prices $p_1, p_2$ and has income $m$. If $p_1$ falls and income $m$ falls, the budget line becomes steeper and shifts outwards.

---

**(Q2)** A consumer has preferences with a diminishing marginal rate of substitution everywhere. This means $x_1$ and $x_2$ are perfect substitutes.

---

**(Q3)** Consider the diagram below, and suppose the consumer’s preferences are complete, reflexive, transitive and monotonic. The consumer’s optimal consumption choice must be $(x_1^*, x_2^*)$ because this is where $MRS = -p_1/p_2$.
