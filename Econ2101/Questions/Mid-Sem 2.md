**(Q1) Answer the following:**

(i) Explain the concept of the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) with reference to a diagram.

(ii) Derive the MRS for the utility function $u(x_1, x_2) = x_1 + 2 \ln(x_2)$, noting that $mu_1 = 1$ and $mu_2 = 2/x_2$. Explain the nature of the MRS for these preferences.

(iii) Draw the income expansion path for these preferences. Explain its shape.

**(Q2)** Suppose there are two consumers. The first one has inverse demand function $p = 8 - q_1$ and the second has the same inverse demand function $p = 8 - q_2$.

(i) Derive the aggregate inverse demand function using diagrams. Explain your steps.

The elasticity of demand is given by the formula
$$
\varepsilon(p) = \frac{p/q}{\Delta p / \Delta q}
$$
i.e. where $\Delta p / \Delta q$ is the slope of the inverse demand function.

(ii) Using this formula, do the following, explaining your steps

(a) Calculate the elasticity of demand of individual consumers at $p = 4$, i.e. $\varepsilon_1(4)$ and $\varepsilon_2(4)$

(b) Calculate the elasticity of Aggregate demand at $p = 4$, i.e. $\varepsilon_A(4)$.

(iii) Compare the individual and aggregate elasticities and explain.

(iv) Do you think this pattern will continue as we add more of the same consumers?
