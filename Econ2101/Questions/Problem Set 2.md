## Question 1

Units of housing $x_H$ are priced at $p_H = 600$ per unit. Units of medicine $x_M$ are priced at $p_M = 400$. Sam’s yearly income is $m = 96,000$.

### (a)
For each of the questions, use the strict definition of the items in **bold** given in the lecture and in Varian chapter 2 and explain each answer.

1. Give a mathematical description of Sam’s yearly budget constraint over housing and medicine.
2. What is Sam’s budget line when housing is on the LHS?
3. Graph (with housing on the horizontal axis) Sam’s budget line, along with their budget set.
4. Find the maximum amount of housing Sam could consume, and the same for medicine.

### (b)
Repeat all of (a) when the price of medicine rises to 500. Discuss how and why the graph from this part differs from that of (a).

### (c)
Repeat part (a) if Sam’s yearly income becomes $102,000$ (after the change in part (b)). Discuss how and why the graph from this part differs from those of (a) and (b). Divide your graph into regions of the following form: “bundles affordable in (a) and (c), but not in (b)” (there are eight possible combinations). Explain.

## Question 2

Graph the budget constraint over two goods, for each of the following situations:

### (a)
The price of good $g$ is $50$, the price of good $h$ is $55$, income is $14,300$.

### (b)
The price of good $g$ is $27$, the price of good $h$ is $22$, income is $66,000$. Explain how and why this graph differs from that in part (a).

### (c)
Good $g$ is free, the price of good $h$ is $1$, income is $100,000$. Explain the shape.

### (d)
Both goods are free. Explain the shape.

### (e)
Good $g$ is twice as expensive as $h$. Income is $1,000$ times the price of $g$. Explain your solution.

## Question 3

Adopting the assumption about consumers from lectures, you are a small consumer compared to the market, and therefore your individual consumption decisions do not affect prices. If you spend all your money on food and entertainment, you can afford, at most, each of the following two distinct bundles: 600 units of food and 500 units of entertainment in a given period, or 500 units of food and 600 units of entertainment.

### (a)
1. Derive the price ratio between food and entertainment.
2. Find the maximum expenditure that can be made on food. Explain your working.

### (b)
How much entertainment could you purchase with all your income? Explain.

### (c)
What can be concluded about the individual values of $p_F$, $p_E$, and $m$ from part (a)? Explain.
