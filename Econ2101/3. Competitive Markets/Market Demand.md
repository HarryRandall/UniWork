### 15.1 From Individual to Market Demand

To get **market demand**, we add up the demand of all consumers for a good. If $x_1^i(p_1, p_2, m_i)$ is consumer $i$'s demand for **good 1**, and $x_2^i(p_1, p_2, m_i)$ is their demand for **good 2**, then with $n$ consumers, the **aggregate demand** for good 1 is:

$$
X_1(p_1, p_2, m_1, \dots, m_n) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_1^i(p_1, p_2, m_i)
$$

The same formula applies to good 2.

---

#### Simplifying with a Representative Consumer

Sometimes we treat all consumers as one **representative consumer** with total income $M$, which is the sum of everyone’s income:

- **Representative Consumer Model**: If each consumer has a budget $m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n$, then $M = m_1 + m_2 + \dots + m_n$.
  - This model treats aggregate demand like one person’s demand with income $M$ and prices $(p_1, p_2)$.
  - **Example**: If there are 3 people with incomes of $100, $200, and $300, the representative consumer would have $M = 600$.

#### The Market Demand Curve

The **market demand curve** shows how quantity demanded changes as the price changes, holding other prices and incomes fixed. Changes in other prices or income will **shift** this curve.

![[Pasted image 20241101145159.png]]

---

#### Examples of Demand Curve Shifts

1. **Substitute Goods**: If goods 1 and 2 are substitutes, raising the price of good 2 increases demand for good 1, shifting the **demand curve for good 1 outward**.
   - **Example**: If tea and coffee are substitutes, an increase in the price of coffee shifts tea's demand curve outward, as people buy more tea.

2. **Complement Goods**: If goods 1 and 2 are complements, raising the price of good 2 lowers demand for good 1, shifting the **demand curve for good 1 inward**.
   - **Example**: If bread and butter are complements, a price increase for butter decreases demand for bread.

3. **Normal Goods**: If good 1 is a normal good, an increase in income shifts the **demand curve for good 1 outward**.
   - **Example**: An increase in consumer income generally increases the demand for normal goods like smartphones.

4. **Representative Consumer and Normal Goods**: In the representative consumer model, an increase in total income $M$ shifts the demand curve for a normal good outward.

--- 
### 15.2 The Inverse Demand Function

The **inverse demand function** shows **price as a function of quantity**. This perspective tells us the price the market would set for a given quantity demanded of a good.

- **Definition**: The inverse demand function, $P(X)$, represents the **market price** needed to demand $X$ units of a good.
- **Marginal Willingness to Pay (MWTP)**: $P(X)$ also reflects the **marginal rate of substitution (MRS)**, or how much consumers are willing to pay for one more unit of the good.
  - **Example**: If $P(X)$ is high, consumers are willing to pay more for each additional unit; if it’s low, their willingness to pay is lower.

---

#### Summing Individual Demand Curves

To get the **market demand curve**, we add up individual demand curves horizontally. This means, for any price, we sum the quantities that each person demands.

- **Horizontal Summing**: At each price, add the quantities demanded by all individuals to find the total market demand.
- **Geometric Interpretation**: This is shown in **Figure 15.2** (insert image here), where the market demand curve is the horizontal sum of individual demand curves.

---

#### Example: Adding Up Linear Demand Curves

Suppose we have two individuals with the following demand functions:
- **Agent 1’s demand**: $D_1(p) = \max \{20 - p, 0\}$
- **Agent 2’s demand**: $D_2(p) = \max \{10 - 2p, 0\}$

The **market demand** is the sum of these individual demands, which introduces a kink at the point where one agent’s demand hits zero.

1. **For $p < 5$**:
   - Both agents demand positive quantities, so we add $D_1(p)$ and $D_2(p)$ directly.
   - **Market demand**: $D_1(p) + D_2(p) = (20 - p) + (10 - 2p) = 30 - 3p$.

2. **For $p \geq 5$**:
   - Agent 2’s demand becomes zero (since $10 - 2p = 0$ when $p = 5$).
   - **Market demand**: Only Agent 1’s demand is positive, so $D_1(p) = 20 - p$.

This results in a **kink** at $p = 5$, as shown in **Figure 15.2**

![[Pasted image 20241101145459.png]]

- **Interpretation**: When demand curves are “linear” for positive quantities, there is often a kink where one demand curve drops to zero, changing the total market demand.

---
### 15.3 Discrete Goods

For **discrete goods**—goods available only in whole units (like 0 or 1)—a consumer’s demand is based on their **reservation price**. This is the maximum price they’re willing to pay for one unit.

- **Individual Demand**: Each consumer’s demand is fully determined by their reservation price. If the price is at or below their reservation price, they’ll buy one unit; otherwise, they’ll buy none.

#### Market Demand for Discrete Goods

To get the **market demand** for a discrete good, we sum the individual demands based on each consumer’s reservation price.

- **Example**: Suppose we have two consumers, **A** and **B**, with different reservation prices.
  - If the price is higher than both A and B’s reservation prices, neither will buy.
  - If the price drops to meet A’s reservation price but not B’s, only A will buy.
  - If the price is at or below both A and B’s reservation prices, both will buy one unit each.
- This creates a **downward-sloping market demand curve** because as the price decreases, more consumers are willing to buy.

![[Pasted image 20241101145643.png]]

#### Key Points

1. **Downward Slope**: The market demand curve for a discrete good slopes downward. Lower prices mean more consumers’ reservation prices are met, so more units are demanded.
2. **Graph Interpretation**: In **Figure 15.3** (insert image here), each step in the demand curve represents an additional consumer willing to buy at a lower price.

By understanding each consumer’s reservation price, we can predict how many units will be demanded in the market as the price changes.

---
### 15.4 The Extensive and the Intensive Margin

In consumer choice, adjustments in demand can occur on two margins: **intensive** and **extensive**.

---

#### Intensive Margin

Adjustments on the **intensive margin** occur when consumers already consuming a good decide to buy **more or less** of it as the price changes.

- **Example**: If the price of apples drops, a consumer who already buys apples might buy more. 
- **Normal Goods**: For normal goods, as price decreases, quantity demanded increases on the intensive margin.

---
#### Extensive Margin

Adjustments on the **extensive margin** involve decisions about **entering or exiting the market** for a good. This happens when consumers decide **whether to buy** the good at all based on their reservation prices.

- **Example**: If the price of gym memberships drops, some people who previously found it too expensive might now join, increasing demand on the extensive margin.

---
#### Combined Impact on Aggregate Demand

The **aggregate demand curve** reflects both types of adjustments:

- **Downward Slope**: Both margins typically work in the "right" direction, meaning that as price decreases, aggregate quantity demanded increases.
- **Graphical Representation**: In **Figure 15.3** (insert image here), we see how market demand is the sum of individual demand curves from Agents A and B, showing how both intensive and extensive margin adjustments contribute to overall demand.

---

![[Pasted image 20241101145643.png]]

**Figure 15.3 Interpretation**:
- **Individual Demand Curves**: Shows each consumer's demand based on their reservation price.
- **Market Demand Curve**: The combined demand curve slopes downward as lower prices lead to increased demand from both current and new consumers.

--- 

#### Summary

- **Intensive Margin**: Changes in the quantity demanded by consumers already in the market.
- **Extensive Margin**: Decisions about entering or exiting the market based on price.
- **Aggregate Demand Curve**: Reflects adjustments on both margins, generally resulting in a downward-sloping demand curve for normal goods.

---

### 15.5 Elasticity

**Elasticity** measures how responsive demand is to changes in price or income. Instead of using the **slope** of the demand curve (which changes with units), elasticity provides a **unit-free measure** of responsiveness by using percentage changes.

---

#### Definition of Price Elasticity of Demand

The **price elasticity of demand** is the **percent change in quantity** divided by the **percent change in price**. This is represented by:

$$
\epsilon = \frac{\Delta q / q}{\Delta p / p} = \frac{p}{q} \cdot \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta p}
$$

- **Interpretation**: Elasticity can be seen as the ratio of price to quantity multiplied by the slope of the demand curve.
- Elasticity is usually **negative** (due to the downward slope of demand curves), but we often refer to the **absolute value** to simplify comparisons.

---

#### Understanding Elasticity Values

1. **Elasticity > 1**: Demand is **elastic**; quantity demanded is very responsive to price changes.
2. **Elasticity < 1**: Demand is **inelastic**; quantity demanded is less responsive to price changes.
3. **Elasticity = 1**: Demand is **unit elastic**; the percentage change in quantity equals the percentage change in price.

---

#### Example: Elasticity of a Linear Demand Curve

Consider a **linear demand curve** of the form $q = a - bp$, where:
- $a$ and $b$ are constants.
- The **slope** of this demand curve is constant, $-b$.

Plugging this into the elasticity formula:

$$
\epsilon = \frac{-bp}{a - bp}
$$

#### Key Points on a Linear Demand Curve:
- **At $p = 0$**: Elasticity is zero, meaning demand is perfectly inelastic.
- **At $q = 0$**: Elasticity is infinite, meaning demand is perfectly elastic.
- **At $p = \frac{a}{2b}$**: Elasticity equals $-1$, which is halfway down the demand curve (see **Figure 15.4**).
 ![[Pasted image 20241101150011.png]]

**Figure 15.4 Interpretation**:
- Elasticity varies along the linear demand curve:
  - It is **infinite** at the top (vertical intercept).
  - It equals **1 halfway down**.
  - It is **zero at the bottom** (horizontal intercept).

This example illustrates that elasticity changes along the curve, even if the slope is constant.

---

#### Summary

- Elasticity provides a **unit-free measure** of demand responsiveness.
- For linear demand curves, elasticity changes along the curve, even if the slope is constant.
- Knowing elasticity helps us understand how quantity demanded will respond to changes in price, guiding pricing and policy decisions.

--- 
### 15.6 Elasticity and Demand

**Elasticity** measures how **responsive demand** is to price changes:

- **Elastic Demand**: Elasticity > 1 (in absolute value)
  - **Definition**: Quantity demanded is highly responsive to price changes.
  - **Example**: A 1% increase in price causes more than a 1% decrease in quantity demanded.
- **Inelastic Demand**: Elasticity < 1 (in absolute value)
  - **Definition**: Quantity demanded is less responsive to price changes.
  - **Example**: A 1% increase in price causes less than a 1% decrease in quantity demanded.
- **Unit Elastic Demand**: Elasticity = -1
  - **Definition**: Quantity demanded changes proportionally with price changes.
  - **Example**: A 1% increase in price leads to exactly a 1% decrease in quantity demanded.

---
#### Factors Influencing Elasticity

The elasticity of a good often depends on **available substitutes**:

1. **Many Close Substitutes**: Higher elasticity
   - **Example**: If red and blue pencils are perfect substitutes, a price increase for red pencils will make demand for them drop to zero as consumers switch to blue pencils.
   - **Interpretation**: Goods with close substitutes are **very elastic** because consumers can easily switch to alternatives.

2. **Few Close Substitutes**: Lower elasticity
   - **Example**: If there are few alternatives to gasoline, even a price increase won't greatly reduce demand.
   - **Interpretation**: Goods without substitutes tend to be **inelastic** because consumers have limited options.

---
#### Key Takeaway

Think of **elasticity** as the **responsiveness of quantity demanded** to price changes:

- **Elastic**: Sensitive to price (many substitutes).
- **Inelastic**: Less sensitive to price (few substitutes).

--- 
### 15.7 Elasticity and Revenue

**Revenue** is the **price** of a good multiplied by the **quantity sold**. When price changes, revenue can either increase or decrease depending on the **elasticity of demand**.

- **Elastic Demand** ($|\epsilon| > 1$): A price increase reduces revenue because quantity demanded drops significantly.
- **Inelastic Demand** ($|\epsilon| < 1$): A price increase raises revenue because quantity demanded decreases only slightly.
- **Unit Elastic Demand** ($|\epsilon| = 1$): A price change leaves revenue unchanged.

---
#### Revenue Change Calculation

For a change in price, we calculate revenue change as follows:

1. **Original Revenue**: $R = p \cdot q$
2. **New Revenue** after price changes to $p + \Delta p$ and quantity changes to $q + \Delta q$:
   $$
   R' = (p + \Delta p)(q + \Delta q) = pq + q \Delta p + p \Delta q + \Delta p \Delta q
   $$
3. **Change in Revenue** ($ \Delta R $):
   $$
   \Delta R = q \Delta p + p \Delta q + \Delta p \Delta q
   $$
   For small changes, $\Delta p \Delta q$ is negligible, so:
   $$
   \Delta R \approx q \Delta p + p \Delta q
   $$

This means the change in revenue is roughly equal to the area added on top of the original revenue box (for $q \Delta p$) minus the area lost on the side (for $p \Delta q$) as shown in **Figure 15.5**.

![[Pasted image 20241101150755.png]]

---
#### Key Condition for Revenue Increase

Revenue increases if the following condition holds:

$$
|\epsilon| < 1
$$

In other words, **if demand is inelastic**, a price increase raises revenue. Conversely, if **demand is elastic** ($|\epsilon| > 1$), a price increase lowers revenue.

---
#### Example: Strikes and Profits

In 1979, a strike cut the supply of lettuce in half, causing a **400% price increase**. Despite halving production, profits nearly doubled due to inelastic demand for lettuce, which allowed the price increase to more than compensate for the reduced quantity.

This example illustrates how **inelastic demand** can lead to higher revenue even with supply disruptions, as consumers don’t reduce their quantity demanded drastically.

---
### 15.8 Constant Elasticity Demands

**Constant Elasticity of Demand** refers to a demand curve where the elasticity remains the same at all points. 

---
#### Linear Demand Curve vs. Constant Elasticity

- **Linear Demand Curve**: Elasticity varies from 0 to infinity as price changes, so it's **not** constant.
- **Constant Elasticity Demand Curve**: Elasticity is the same at every price level, which can be achieved by a demand function with **elasticity of -1**.

---
#### Deriving Constant Elasticity

To get a constant elasticity of -1:
1. **Revenue Approach**: If elasticity is -1, revenue remains unchanged with small price changes.
2. **Formula**: For constant elasticity of -1, we want $p \cdot q = R$ (constant revenue). Therefore, 
   $$
   q = \frac{R}{p}
   $$
   This formula ensures that **price times quantity remains constant** along the demand curve.

3. **Graph Interpretation**: In **Figure 15.6**, the demand curve shows that as price changes, quantity adjusts to keep $p \cdot q$ constant.

![[Pasted image 20241101151051.png]]

---
#### General Formula for Constant Elasticity

For other constant elasticities, the demand curve can be written as:
$$
q = A \cdot p^{\epsilon}
$$
where:
- $A$ is a positive constant,
- $\epsilon$ (elasticity) is typically negative.

#### Logarithmic Form

An alternative way to express constant elasticity demand is to take the logarithm:
$$
\ln q = \ln A + \epsilon \ln p
$$
In this form, **$\ln q$ depends linearly on $\ln p$**, which is convenient for some economic models.

---
#### Summary

- **Constant Elasticity Demand** maintains the same elasticity across all prices.
- For **elasticity of -1**, revenue remains constant along the demand curve.
- **General formula**: $q = A \cdot p^{\epsilon}$ where elasticity $\epsilon$ is constant.

---
### 15.9 Elasticity and Marginal Revenue

In section 15.7, we looked at how **revenue changes with price**. Here, we examine **how revenue changes with quantity**, which is especially useful for **production decisions** by firms.

---
#### Marginal Revenue Formula

For small changes in price and quantity, the change in revenue ($\Delta R$) is given by:
$$
\Delta R = p \Delta q + q \Delta p
$$
Dividing by $\Delta q$ gives **Marginal Revenue (MR)**:
$$
MR = \frac{\Delta R}{\Delta q} = p + q \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta q}
$$
---
#### Rearranging with Elasticity

We can rearrange this formula by factoring out $p$:
$$
MR = p \left[ 1 + \frac{q \Delta p}{p \Delta q} \right]
$$
The second term, $\frac{q \Delta p}{p \Delta q}$, is the **reciprocal of elasticity**:
$$
\frac{\Delta R}{\Delta q} = p(q) \left[ 1 + \frac{1}{\epsilon(q)} \right]
$$
For clarity, we sometimes use the absolute value of elasticity $|\epsilon|$:
$$
\frac{\Delta R}{\Delta q} = p(q) \left[ 1 - \frac{1}{|\epsilon(q)|} \right]
$$

---
#### Key Insights on Elasticity and Marginal Revenue

- **Elastic Demand ($|\epsilon| > 1$)**: Revenue **increases** with more output.
- **Inelastic Demand ($|\epsilon| < 1$)**: Revenue **decreases** with more output.
- **Unit Elasticity ($|\epsilon| = 1$)**: Marginal revenue is zero, meaning revenue doesn’t change when output changes.

If demand is inelastic, you need to **lower prices significantly** to increase output, which leads to a drop in revenue. This aligns with our earlier discussion: as **quantity increases, price decreases**, and vice versa.

---
#### Example: Setting a Price

Imagine you're setting the price for a product and want to **maximize profits** (revenue minus costs). You wouldn’t want to price it where **demand is inelastic** ($|\epsilon| < 1$). Why?

- If demand is inelastic, raising the price would increase revenue, and **lower the quantity sold**.
- Lower quantity means **lower production costs** (or at least no increase).
- Thus, **overall profit would rise** by increasing the price.

So, **operating in the inelastic range of the demand curve cannot yield maximal profits** because revenue decreases when output increases.

---

**Summary**: When setting prices, aim to operate where demand is **elastic** to maximize revenue. Using the marginal revenue formula and understanding elasticity can guide effective pricing and production decisions.

---

### 15.10 Marginal Revenue Curves

The **marginal revenue** (MR) of selling one more unit depends on the price and how much the price must be reduced to sell that extra unit. When demand is elastic, MR is positive; when demand is inelastic, MR becomes negative.

---

#### Marginal Revenue Formula Recap

Marginal Revenue is given by:
$$
MR = p(q) \left[ 1 - \frac{1}{|\epsilon(q)|} \right]
$$
where:
- $p(q)$ is the price at quantity $q$.
- $\epsilon(q)$ is the elasticity of demand at quantity $q$.

---
#### Understanding the Marginal Revenue Curve

1. **First Unit**: When $q = 0$, MR equals the price $p(q)$ because there's no need to reduce the price yet.
2. **After the First Unit**: As more units are sold, MR decreases below the price due to the price reduction needed to sell additional units.

   - Selling extra units requires **lowering the price**, which **reduces revenue on all previously sold units**.

---
#### Example: Linear Demand Curve

For a **linear demand curve** where:
$$
p(q) = a - bq
$$
we have a constant slope:
$$
\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta q} = -b
$$
Then, the marginal revenue becomes:
$$
MR = a - 2bq
$$

This means:
- **Slope of MR** is **twice as steep** as the demand curve’s slope.
- MR is **zero when $q = a/2b$**, where elasticity equals -1.
- **MR becomes negative** for quantities larger than $a/2b$, indicating inelastic demand.

![[Pasted image 20241101151436.png]]

---
#### Constant Elasticity Demand Curve

For a **constant elasticity demand curve**:
$$
MR = p(q) \left[ 1 - \frac{1}{|\epsilon|} \right]
$$
- If $|\epsilon| = 1$: MR is zero across all quantities (unit elastic).
- If $|\epsilon| > 1$: MR lies below the demand curve but remains positive (elastic demand).
- If $|\epsilon| < 1$: MR is negative (inelastic demand).

![[Pasted image 20241101151448.png]]

---
#### Summary

- **Marginal Revenue Curve**: Starts at price for the first unit and declines with quantity.
- **Linear Demand Curve**: MR curve has the same intercept as demand but twice the slope.
- **Constant Elasticity Demand Curve**: MR remains a fixed fraction of the inverse demand curve.

---
### 15.11 Income Elasticity

**Income elasticity** measures how **quantity demanded** responds to changes in **income**, providing a unit-free measure similar to price elasticity.

---
#### Definition

Income Elasticity of Demand:
$$
\text{Income Elasticity} = \frac{\% \text{ change in quantity demanded}}{\% \text{ change in income}}
$$

- **Normal Goods**: Positive income elasticity (demand increases as income rises).
- **Inferior Goods**: Negative income elasticity (demand decreases as income rises).
- **Luxury Goods**: Income elasticity greater than 1 (demand increases more than proportionally with income).

---
#### Relationship with Budget Constraint

For two income levels, let:
- $p_1 x'_1 + p_2 x'_2 = m'$ (new income level)
- $p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 = m$ (initial income level)

By subtracting these and simplifying, we find:
$$
s_1 \frac{\Delta x_1 / x_1}{\Delta m / m} + s_2 \frac{\Delta x_2 / x_2}{\Delta m / m} = 1
$$
where $s_i$ represents the **expenditure share** of good $i$.

This equation implies:
- The **weighted average of income elasticities is 1**.
- Goods with **high income elasticity (luxury goods)** are balanced by goods with **lower income elasticity**.

---
#### Summary

- **Income Elasticity** helps classify goods as **normal**, **inferior**, or **luxury**.
- **Budget Constraint** suggests that, on average, income elasticities tend to cluster around 1, balancing goods with different income elasticities.
