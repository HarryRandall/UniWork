### 15.1 From Individual to Market Demand
##### Key Concepts
1. Individual Demand: Each consumer's demand for good 1 is represented by:
$$x^1_i(p_1, p_2, m_i)$$
	Where:
	- $p_1$ and $p_2$ are prices of goods 1 and 2.
	- $m_i$ is the income of the consumer $i$.

2. Aggregate Demand: To find the demand for good 1, we sum up each consumer's demand:
$$X^1(p_1, p_2, m_1, \dots, m_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n x^1_i(p_1, p_2, m_i)$$
	The aggregate demand function depends on individual income by prices.

3. Representative Consumer: Sometimes, economists simplify by assuming a "representative consumer" with a total income:
$$M = \sum m_i$$
	This lets us model aggregate demand as if one consumer with income $M$ represents the market.

4. **Market Demand Curve:** The market demand curve shows the relationship between the quantity demanded of good 1 and it's price $p$, holding other prices and incomes constant.

##### Demand Shifts
- **Substitutes:** If good 1 and good 2 are substitutes, an increase in the price of good 2 shifts the demand curve for good 1 outward.
- **Complements:** If they are complements, an increase in the price of good 2 shifts the demand curve for good 1 inward.
- **Normal Good:** If good 1 is a normal good, an increase in aggregate income (assuming the representative consumer model) shifts the demand curve outward.

### 15.2 The Inverse Demand Function
The aggregate demand curve can be viewed in two ways:
- Standard demand function: Quantity as a function of price
- Inverse demand function: Price as a function of quantity, denoted $P(X)$
