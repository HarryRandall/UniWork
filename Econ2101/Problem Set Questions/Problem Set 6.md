## Question 1

ACME Corporation (ASX: ACM) uses labour $x_L$ and steel $x_S$ to produce anvils. A unit of labour costs $w$. A unit of steel costs $p$. ACME’s total budget for anvil production is $c = 10,000$, with $w = 50$ and $p = 25$. ACME produces anvils according to the production function $y = f(x_L, x_S) = x_L + 10 \sqrt{x_S}$.

### (a)
Depict ACME’s iso-cost line, labelling all the information above, with labour on the x-axis, and steel on the y-axis. What is the equation for this line and what does it signify?

### (b)
Add the iso-quant for the optimal mix of steel and labour to your diagram. What is its slope? Explain.

### (c)
Find the conditional factor demands with arbitrary cost $C$. Explain.

### (d)
Why is it essential to solving ACME’s production problem that its quantity of anvils produced does not affect the price of its anvils?

## Question 2

*Note: the material for parts (b) and (c) may not be covered in the Friday lecture in time. In this case, please submit just part (a). This question uses the same set-up as the last.*

### (a)
If ACME produces 400 anvils, if factor prices remain the same as before, and inputs are totally flexible, what must its levels of factor inputs and cost be?

### (b)
Repeat part (a) under the assumption that, due to collective bargaining or difficulty hiring, the level of labour input is fixed at 200, and ACME must produce $y$ anvils.

### (c)
Under the regime of part (b), what are fixed costs, variable costs, average costs, marginal costs, average fixed costs, and average variable costs of ACME? Explain all functions.
