## Question 1

You spend all of your income on food and shelter. Your yearly food consumption is the quantity $x_F$. Your yearly consumption of units of shelter (e.g., units of time rented) is given by $x_S$. Thus, you consume the bundle $(x_F, x_S)$, where we adopt the convention of listing food first. You like all bundles $(x_F, x_S)$ such that $x_F x_S = 400$ equally well. The same is true of the set of all bundles with $x_F x_S = 576$.

### (a)
1. Graph your indifference curves for the reference bundles $(8, 72)$ and $(40, 10)$, respectively. Which of these two bundles do you prefer and why?
2. Identify the weakly preferred set for the reference bundles $(40, 10)$ and $(8, 72)$, respectively.

### (b)
For each of the following pairs of bundles, explain whether the first bundle is preferred to the second, the second is preferred to the first, the two are indifferent, or there is not enough information to tell: $(24, 24)$ and $(72, 8)$, $(12, 12)$ and $(40, 40)$, $(100, 4)$ and $(201, 2)$, $(12, 12)$ and $(4, 36)$.

### (c)
Denote a shape in the $x_1, x_2$ plane as $S$. $S$ is called convex if, whenever $X$ and $Y$ are points contained in $S$, the whole line between $X$ and $Y$ is contained in $S$. To practice thinking about this definition, it helps to draw the following examples: a filled-in circle is convex, a filled-in square is convex, two disjoint (i.e., not intersecting) filled-in circles are not convex (when considered as one set), a hollow circle is not convex, an arc of a hollow circle is not convex. Using this definition, answer the following:
   - Is the set of bundles weakly preferred to $(8, 72)$ convex?
   - What about those bundles to which $(20, 20)$ is preferred?

### (d)
Do your indifference curves exhibit diminishing marginal rate of substitution (MRS)? What is the MRS between food and shelter at $(40, 10)$? What about $(72, 8)$?

## Question 2

You like all bundles $(x_F, x_S)$ with $\sqrt{2} x_F + x_S = 100$ equally well.

### (a)
Draw your indifference curves through the points $(200, 80)$ and $(2048, 36)$. Shade the areas of bundles weakly preferred to $(200, 80)$ and bundles that $(2048, 36)$ is weakly preferred to. Which of the two sets is convex?

### (b)
Suppose in the bundle $(x_F, x_S)$ that $x_F = \frac{x_S^2}{2} - 100x_S + 5000$. Find the MRS at this point.

### (c)
Do your indifference curves exhibit a diminishing MRS?

## Question 3 (harder)

Fred has preferences over quantities in the $(x_1, x_2)$ plane defined as follows: $(x_1, x_2) \succeq (y_1, y_2)$ if either $x_1 > y_1$ or $x_1 = y_1$ and $x_2 \geq y_2$. The symbols $>$ and $\geq$ are the usual “greater than” and “greater than or equal to” symbols (respectively) used for numbers.

1. Explain these preferences in words, where good 1 refers to bananas and good 2 refers to apples.

1. Are these preferences transitive? Explain.
