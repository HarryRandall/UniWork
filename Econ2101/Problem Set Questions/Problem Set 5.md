## Question 1

Consider the exchange economy described in the in-class problem discussed in tutorials in week 9 (posted on Wattle under week 9) and answer the following. Carefully and clearly draw an Edgeworth box diagram to illustrate the following. In your diagram, make the origin for consumer A the bottom left and for consumer B the top right, with good 2 on the vertical and good 1 on the horizontal axis.

1. The set of core allocations: An allocation is in the core of the economy if it is (i) feasible and (ii) not blocked by any coalition of consumers (for any sized coalition there is no allocation where at least one consumer can be made strictly better off). Succinctly, the core is the set of unblocked feasible allocations. *(Note: Harder–this concept is not covered in Varian.)*

2. Is the Walrasian equilibrium in the set of core allocations? Explain.

## Question 2

Now suppose the consumers have preferences given as follows:

$u_A(x_1^A, x_2^A) = \alpha \log x_1^A + (1 - \alpha) \log x_2^A$
$u_B(x_1^B, x_2^B) = \beta \log x_1^B + (1 - \beta) \log x_2^B$

### (a)
Derive the set of Pareto efficient allocations. Express your answer in the form of $x_2^A$ as a function of $x_1^A$ with an appropriate domain for $x_1^A$, and specify how $x_1^B$ and $x_2^B$ are determined from this relationship. *Hint: Look at your answer in Question 1 to help visualize what you are solving for.* Explain your working.

### (b)
Derive the Walrasian equilibrium price and allocation, where the allocation is expressed in the same form as (a). Explain your working.

### (c)
Suppose that $\alpha = \beta$ and use the Edgeworth box diagram to compare the outcomes of (a) and (b) for the case where consumers have identical endowments, to the case where their endowments are different. Explain what you can conclude about the basis for exchange in this situation (i.e., for this ‘economy’).

### (d)
Suppose that consumers have identical endowments, and use the Edgeworth box diagram to compare the case where consumers have preferences with $\alpha = \beta$ with the case where they have preferences $\alpha' > \beta'$. Explain what you can conclude about the basis for exchange for this ‘economy’.

## Question 3

Tyrell Corp. uses chemicals $x_1$ and $x_2$ to produce organic product $y = 5x_1^{1/3} x_2^{1/6}$.

### (a)
1. Find the marginal products $MP_1(x_1, x_2)$ and $MP_2(x_1, x_2)$ with respect to $x_1$ and $x_2$. Explain.
2. Determine whether each exhibits diminishing marginal product. Explain the concept with reference to an example.

### (b)
1. Explain the concept of $TRS(x_1, x_2)$.
2. Find the technical rate of substitution between the two chemicals.
3. Draw an isoquant diagram with $x_2$ on the vertical axis and $x_1$ on the horizontal axis depicting the TRS.
4. Does this technology exhibit diminishing TRS? Explain what this means.

### (c)
Explain if the returns to scale from this production function are increasing, decreasing, or constant.

### (d)
What is Tyrell Corp.’s long-run profit maximization problem? How can you use this to find its unconditional factor demands for chemicals $x_1$ and $x_2$?
