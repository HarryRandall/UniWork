The theory of the customer assumers consumers choose the best bundle they can afford.
1. **"Best":** Relates to preferences and utility.
2. **"Can afford":** Tied to the budget constraint.
This setup allows for detailed analysis of consumer choices.

### 2.1 The Budget Constraint
The Budget Constraint represents the combinations of goods a consumer can afford. We simplify by assuming there are only two good, denoted by a consumption bundle $(x_1, x_2)$ where $x_1$ is the amount of good 1 and $x_2$ is the amount of good 2.
- **Prices and Income:** Let $(p_1, p_2)$ represent the prices of the goods, and $m$ represent the consumers total income.
- **Budget Constraint Equation:** The budget constraint is given by $p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 \le m$, where $p_1x_1$ is the spending on good 1 and $p_2x_2$ is the spending on good 2.
- **Budget Set:** This is the set for all bundles that cost no more than image $m$, representing all affordable consumption choices at prices $(p_1, p_2)$. A big list of all possible things you could buy that cost less than your income.
The budget constraint limits the consumer's choices to what they can afford based on their income and the prices of goods.

### 2.2 Two Good Are Often Enough
The two-good assumption is flexible because we can interpret **good 2** as representing all other goods the consumer might buy. For example:
1. Specific vs Composite Goods
	- If $x_1$ represents milk (in quarts per month), then $x_2$ can represent everything else the consumer consumes.
	- By interpreting **good 2** as all other spending, it's price $p_2$ is set to 1 (since one dollar costs one dollar)
2. Budget Constraint Form
	- The budget constrain then becomes $p_1x_1 + x_2 \le m$, meaning the spending on good 1 plus other goods must not exceed income $m$ 
3. Composite Good Interpretation:
	- Good 2, or the composite good, measure all other goods in terms of dollars, simplifying analysis by letting **good 2** represent all other consumption.
This approach keeps the two-good model general and simplifies the budget constraint without losing any analytical power.

### 2.3 Properties of the Budget Set
The budget line represents all combinations of goods that cost exactly $m$, given by the equation:
$$p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = m$$
where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are quantities of good 1 and 2, respectively, and $p_1$ and $p_2$ are their prices.

##### Intercepts
- **Vertical intercepts:** $\frac{m}{p_2}$, representing how much of good 2 the consumer can buy if all income is spent on it.
- **Horizontal intercepts:** $\frac{m}{p_2}$, representing how much of good 1 the consumer can buy if all income is spent on it.
##### Slope of the budget line
- The slop is $-\frac{p_1}{p_2}$, indicating the rate of substitution between goods 1 and 2 while staying within the budget.
- This slope represents the opportunity cost of consuming more of good 1 in terms of how much good 2 must be given up.
##### Economic Interpretation
The budget line's slop reflects the market trade off between the two good. For a change in good 1 ($\Delta x_1$), the required change in good 2 ($\Delta x_2$) to stay on the budget line is given by:$$\frac{\Delta x_2}{\Delta x_1} = -\frac{p_1}{p_2}$$  This trade-off highlights the opportunity cost of choosing more of one good over the other.

### 2.4 How the Budget Line Changes
Changes in income and prices alter the budget line and budget set.
##### Income Changes
- **Increase in income** shifts the budget lines **outwards** in a parallel manner (figure below) without changing its slope.
- **Decrease in income** shifts the budget line **inward** in parallel, reducing the set of affordable goods.

##### Price Changes
- **Increase** in $p_1$, while keeping $p_2$ and income $m$ fixed, makes the budget line steeper, as $-\frac{p_1}{p_2}$ increases (figure below).
- **Decrease** in $p_1$ makes the line flatter.

##### Proportional Changes
- Doubling both prices is equivalent to halving income, shifting the budget line inward by half.
- Algebraically, if both prices increase by $t$, it's equivalent to dividing income by $t$: $p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = \frac{m}{t}$
##### Combined Changes
- If both income decreases and price increase, the budget line shifts inward.
- Relative price changes after the slope. If $p_2$ rises more than $p_1$, the line flattens; if $p_1$ rises more, it becomes steeper.

These adjustments reflect how economic constraints evolve with varying income and price conditions.

### 2.5 The Numeraire
The numeraire simplifies the budget line by fixing one price or income to 1, allowing all other variables to be expressed relative to it. This doesn't change the budget set but reduces the complexity of analysis.
##### Budget Line Transformations
- Starting with $p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = m$
	- Dividing by $p_2$: $\frac{p_1}{p_2}x_1 + x_2 = \frac{m}{p_2}$, setting $p_2 =1$
	- Dividing by $m$: $\frac{p_1}{m}x_1 + \frac{p_2}{m}x_2 = 1$, setting $m=1$
##### Numeraire Price
The numeraire is the reference price, typically set to 1, to measure other prices and income relative to it. Setting a numeraire (like $p_2 = 1$) simplifies analysis by reducing the number of variables in the budget constraint.

Using a **numeraire good** reduces complexity by standardising one price or income and making it easier to analyse consumer choices.

### 2.6 Taxes, Subsidies, and Rationing
Economic policies like taxes and subsidies affect a customer's budget constraint by altering the effective price of goods.
- **Quantity Tax:** Adds a fixed tax $t$ per unit of a good. If good 1's price is $p_1$, it becomes $p_1+t$, making the budget line steeper (higher cost per unit).
- **Value Tax:** A percentage tax, like sales tax, applied to the good's price. If the tax rate is $\tau$, the consumer pays ($1+\tau$)$p_1$.
##### Subsidies
- **Quantity Subsidy:** Reduces the effective price per unit of a good. If the subsidy is $s$ per unit, then the price of good 1 becomes $p_1 - s$, making the budget line flatter (lower cost per unit).
- **Ad Valorem Subsidy:** A percentage reduction on the price of the good. With a subsidy rate of $\sigma$, the effective price is ($1-\sigma$)$p_1$.
##### Lump-Sum Taxes and Subsidies
- **Lump-Sum Tax:** A fixed amount taken regardless of behaviour, shifting the budget line inward as total income decreases. 
- **Combined Tax and Rationing** If a tax $t$ applies only after a certain level $\bar{x_1}$, the budget line has a steeper slope to the right of $\bar{x_1}$, reflecting the higher cost per additional unit beyond the limit.

##### Food Stamps Program Example
Before 19979, the U.S. households could buy subsidised food stamps, creating a "kinked" budget line that allowed more food consumption at a lower effective price. After 1979, food stamps became a lump-sum subsidy (no purchase required), shifting the budget line outward by the amount of food stamps provided but keeping the slope unchanged.

### 2.7 Budget Line Changes
The budget line movements reveal insights about consumers optimal choice and well-being.
##### Balance Inflation
If all prices and income are multiplied by the same positive number, the budget line remains unchanged. This means that balanced inflation doesn't affect the consumer's optimal choice, as the budget set stays the same.
##### Increased Income
If income increases while prices remain constant, the budget line shifts outward in a parallel manner. The consumer has the same options as before, plus more. Therefore, the consumers must be at least as well-off as they were with lower income.
##### Price Decline
If the price of one good declines while others stay the same, the consumer's budget line expands in that direction. This gives the consumer more options, implying they are at least as well-off as before.

These observations lay the groundwork for understanding how consumers adjust their choices under changes in price and income.

### Summary
1. **Budget Set:** The budget set consists of all bundles of goods that a consumer can afford at given prices and incomes. We typically assume only two goods.
2. **Budget Line:** The budget line is represented as $p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = m$, with:
	- **Slope**: $-\frac{p_1}{p_2}$
	- **Vertical Intercept:** $\frac{m}{p_2}$
	- **Horizontal Intercept**: $\frac{m}{p_1}$
3. Effects of Income and Price Changes
	- Increasing income shifts the budget line outward $m \uparrow$
	- Increasing the price of good 1 makes the budget line steeper $p_1 \uparrow$
	- Increasing the price of good 2 makes the budget line flatter $p_2 \uparrow$
4. Impact of Taxes, subsidies, and rationing:
	- Taxes, subsidies, and rationing adjust the slope and position the budget line by changing the effective prices faced by the customer ($p_1$, $p_2$, $m$).
