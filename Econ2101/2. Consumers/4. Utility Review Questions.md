1. The text said that raising a number to an odd power was a monotonic transformation. What about raising a number to an even power? Is this a monotonic transformation? (Hint: consider the case $f(u) = u^2$.)

2. Which of the following are monotonic transformations?
   - (1) $u = 2v - 13$ 
   - (2) $u = -\frac{1}{v^2}$
   - (3) $u = \frac{1}{v^2}$
   - (4) $u = \ln v$
   - (5) $u = -e^{-v}$
   - (6) $u = v^2$
   - (7) $u = v^2$ for $v > 0$
   - (8) $u = v^2$ for $v < 0$

3. We claimed in the text that if preferences were monotonic, then a diagonal line through the origin would intersect each indifference curve exactly once. Can you prove this rigorously? (Hint: what would happen if it intersected some indifference curve twice?)

4. What kind of preferences are represented by a utility function of the form $u(x_1, x_2) = \sqrt{x_1} + x_2$? What about the utility function $v(x_1, x_2) = 13x_1 + 13x_2$?
---
5. What kind of preferences are represented by a utility function of the form $u(x_1, x_2) = x_1 + \sqrt{x_2}$? Is the utility function $v(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 + 2x_1 \sqrt{x_2} + x_2$ a monotonic transformation of $u(x_1, x_2)$?
---
6. Consider the utility function $u(x_1, x_2) = \sqrt{x_1x_2}$. What kind of preferences does it represent? Is the function $v(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 x_2$ a monotonic transformation of $u(x_1, x_2)$? Is the function $w(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 x_2^2$ a monotonic transformation of $u(x_1, x_2)$?
---
7. Can you explain why taking a monotonic transformation of a utility function doesnâ€™t change the marginal rate of substitution?
