2. Consider a group of people $A$, $B$, $C$ and the relation “at least as tall as,” as in “$A$ is at least as tall as $B$.” Is this relation transitive? Is it complete?
---
3. Take the same group of people and consider the relation “strictly taller than.” Is this relation transitive? Is it reflexive? Is it complete?

4. A college football coach says that given any two linemen $A$ and $B$, he always prefers the one who is bigger and faster. Is this preference relation transitive? Is it complete?

5. Can an indifference curve cross itself? For example, could Figure 3.2 depict a single indifference curve?
---
6. Could Figure 3.2 be a single indifference curve if preferences are monotonic?
---
7. If both pepperoni and anchovies are bads, will the indifference curve have a positive or a negative slope?
---
8. Explain why convex preferences mean that “averages are preferred to extremes.”
