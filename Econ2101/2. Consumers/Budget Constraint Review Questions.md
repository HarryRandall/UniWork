# Textbook Questions

1. Originally the consumer faces the budget line $p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = m$. Then the price of good 1 doubles, the price of good 2 becomes 8 times larger, and income becomes 4 times larger. Write down an equation for the new budget line in terms of the original prices and income.
$2p_1x_1 + 8p_2x_2 = 4m$
---
2. What happens to the budget line if the price of good 2 increases, but the price of good 1 and income remain constant?
---
4. If the price of good 1 doubles and the price of good 2 triples, does the budget line become flatter or steeper?
---
5. What is the definition of a numeraire good?
When a good is chosen as a reference point by setting its price to 1, allowing all other prices and income to be expressed relative to it. This simplifies the budget constraint by reducing the number of variables.

6. Suppose that the government puts a tax of 15 cents a gallon on gasoline and then later decides to put a subsidy on gasoline at a rate of 7 cents a gallon. What net tax is this combination equivalent to?

$-15c + 7c = -8c$
---
7. Suppose that a budget equation is given by $p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = m$. The government decides to impose a lump-sum tax of $u$, a quantity tax on good 1 of $t$, and a quantity subsidy on good 2 of $s$. What is the formula for the new budget line?
---
8. If the income of the consumer increases and one of the prices decreases at the same time, will the consumer necessarily be at least as well-off?

## Question 1

Units of housing $x_H$ are priced at $p_H = 600$ per unit. Units of medicine $x_M$ are priced at $p_M = 400$. Sam’s yearly income is $m = 96,000$.

**(a)**  
   **(i)** Give a mathematical description of Sam’s yearly budget constraint over housing and medicine.  
   **(ii)** What is Sam’s budget line when housing is on the LHS?  
   **(iii)** Graph (with housing on the horizontal axis) Sam’s budget line, along with the budget set.  
   **(iv)** Find the maximum amount of housing and medicine Sam could consume.

**(b)** Repeat all of part (a) when the price of medicine rises to 500. Discuss how and why this graph differs from part (a).

**(c)** Repeat part (a) if Sam’s yearly income becomes 102,000 (after the change in part (b)). Discuss how and why this graph differs from those in (a) and (b). Divide your graph into regions such as “bundles affordable in (a) and (c), but not in (b).”

## Question 2

Graph the budget constraint over two goods in each situation:

**(a)** The price of good $g$ is 50, the price of good $h$ is 55, income is 14,300.  
**(b)** The price of good $g$ is 27, the price of good $h$ is 22, income is 66,000. Explain the difference from (a).  
**(c)** Good $g$ is free, the price of good $h$ is 1, income is 100,000. Explain the shape.  
**(d)** Both goods are free. Explain the shape.  
**(e)** Good $g$ is twice as expensive as $h$. Income is 1,000 times the price of $g$. Explain.

## Question 3

Assume you are a small consumer in the market, and your decisions do not affect prices. You can afford the following bundles: 600 units of food and 500 units of entertainment, or 500 units of food and 600 units of entertainment.

**(a)**  
   **(i)** Derive the price ratio between food and entertainment.  
   **(ii)** Find the maximum expenditure on food. Explain.

**(b)** How much entertainment could you purchase with all your income? Explain.

**(c)** Conclude the individual values of $p_F$, $p_E$, and $m$ from (a).
