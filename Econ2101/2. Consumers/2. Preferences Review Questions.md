1. If we observe a consumer choosing $(x_1, x_2)$ when $(y_1, y_2)$ is available one time, are we justified in concluding that $(x_1, x_2) \succ (y_1, y_2)$?

No, as $(x_1, x_2) \succ (y_1, y_2)$ could be $(x_1, x_2) \succeq (y_1, y_2)$. 

2. Consider a group of people A, B, C and the relation “at least as tall as,” as in “A is at least as tall as B.” Is this relation transitive? Is it complete?

Yes to both

3. Take the same group of people and consider the relation “strictly taller than.” Is this relation transitive? Is it reflexive? Is it complete?

It is now not complete.

4. A college football coach says that given any two linemen A and B, he always prefers the one who is bigger and faster. Is this preference relation transitive? Is it complete?

It is transitive, not complete.

5. Can an indifference curve cross itself? For example, could Figure 3.2 depict a single indifference curve?

Yes, they just can't cross another distance indifference curve.

6. Could Figure 3.2 be a single indifference curve if preferences are monotonic?

No, because there are bundles on the indifference curve that have more goods than other bundles.
