1. Suppose that there were 25 people who had a reservation price of \$500, and the 26th person had a reservation price of \$200. What would the demand curve look like?
---
2. In the above example, what would the equilibrium price be if there were 24 apartments to rent? What if there were 26 apartments to rent? What if there were 25 apartments to rent?
---
3. If people have different reservation prices, why does the market demand curve slope down?
---
4. In the text, we assumed that the condominium purchasers came from the inner-ring people—people who were already renting apartments. What would happen to the price of inner-ring apartments if all the condominium purchasers were outer-ring people—the people who were not currently renting apartments in the inner ring?
---
5. Suppose now that the condominium purchasers were all inner-ring people, but that each condominium was constructed from two apartments. What would happen to the price of apartments?
---
6. What do you suppose the effect of a tax would be on the number of apartments that would be built in the long run?
---
7. Suppose the demand curve is \(D(p) = 100 - 2p\). What price would the monopolist set if he had 60 apartments? How many would he rent? What price would he set if he had 40 apartments? How many would he rent?
---
8. If our model of rent control allowed for unrestricted subletting, who would end up getting apartments in the inner circle? Would the outcome be Pareto efficient?

## Question 1

In County Omega, there are 10 couples in the market for two-bedroom apartments—hereafter, "apartments": 
Annie and Angus, Barry and Boris, Celia and Chandra, Delilah and Daisy, Emanuelle and Ellis, Fatima and Frida, George and Gok, Harriet and Hussein, Isla and Ian, and Janet and Jose. For the purposes of this question, consider each couple to behave as a single economic decision-maker with its own preferences.

The reservation prices for apartments of the couples are summarized in the table below. County Omega fits the model used in Chapter 1 of Varian: reservation prices are for inner-ring apartments, and less desirable outer-ring apartments can be bought at an exogenous price. However, if a landlord who sells to the marginal buyer offers a buyer their reservation price (and faces no competition in the form of inner-ring apartments at lower prices), they will always be able to sell, even if the buyer is then indifferent between inner and outer apartments.


|      Couple      | Reservation Price ($) |
| :--------------: | :-------------------: |
|   Annie, Angus   |         9,000         |
|   Barry, Boris   |         4,000         |
|  Celia, Chandra  |         7,500         |
|  Delilah, Daisy  |         4,300         |
| Emanuelle, Ellis |         6,400         |
|  Fatima, Frida   |         8,000         |
|   George, Gok    |         7,900         |
| Harriet, Hussein |        10,000         |
|    Isla, Ian     |         6,200         |
|   Janet, Jose    |         9,300         |



1. **(a)** Make a graph showing market demand for apartments in County Omega.
2. **(b)** If in the short-run, only six apartments are available, what will be the equilibrium price in the market for apartments in County Omega? Which couples will rent apartments in County Omega? Suppose that flexible work arrangements lead more businesses to sell offices, which are converted into two new apartments in County Omega. Which couples will obtain apartments then? Answer with reference to your graph.

## Question 2

Suppose there are initially six apartments, but that one of the couples inherits a house, which they much prefer to an apartment.

**A.** **(i)** If we do not know which couple inherited the house, what are the possible equilibrium prices in the market for apartments in County Omega? **(ii)** How is the price affected when different couples inherit and why?

**(b)** Now, suppose that the number of couples looking for apartments in County Omega doubles (in this scenario, no one is inheriting a house). For each previous couple, there is now a couple with a reservation price $100 below theirs. Suppose that the supply of apartments is 11. Graph the new market demand in County Omega.

**(c)** Now, suppose again, under the assumptions of (b), that one couple inherits a house. Using your diagram for reference, explain whether or not it is possible for the new equilibrium price to be different from that found in part (b).

## Question 3

In this question, we consider a market consisting of the 10 consumers from Question 1. Suppose that all \( n $\leq$ 10 \) apartments in County Omega are in the same building, rented by the same conglomerate at no marginal cost.

**(a)** Assume that the conglomerate must sell all apartments at the same price. For each possible value of \( n \), find the maximum price the conglomerate could set to sell that many apartments in County Omega, and how much revenue it makes.

**(b)** 
    **(i)** If there are 6 apartments in the building, what quantity and price would the conglomerate choose?
    **(ii)** Which couples would rent apartments?
    **(iii)** How and why does this differ or stay the same as your answer to 1(b).

**(c)** If every apartment can be sold at a different price, with 6 available, find the price and quantity sold, and the couples that obtain apartments. Compare this to the competitive equilibrium of 1(b) and to part (b) of this question.
