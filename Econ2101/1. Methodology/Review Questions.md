1. Suppose that there were 25 people who had a reservation price of \$500, and the 26th person had a reservation price of \$200. What would the demand curve look like?

2. In the above example, what would the equilibrium price be if there were 24 apartments to rent? What if there were 26 apartments to rent? What if there were 25 apartments to rent?

3. If people have different reservation prices, why does the market demand curve slope down?

4. In the text, we assumed that the condominium purchasers came from the inner-ring people—people who were already renting apartments. What would happen to the price of inner-ring apartments if all the condominium purchasers were outer-ring people—the people who were not currently renting apartments in the inner ring?

5. Suppose now that the condominium purchasers were all inner-ring people, but that each condominium was constructed from two apartments. What would happen to the price of apartments?

6. What do you suppose the effect of a tax would be on the number of apartments that would be built in the long run?

7. Suppose the demand curve is \(D(p) = 100 - 2p\). What price would the monopolist set if he had 60 apartments? How many would he rent? What price would he set if he had 40 apartments? How many would he rent?

8. If our model of rent control allowed for unrestricted subletting, who would end up getting apartments in the inner circle? Would the outcome be Pareto efficient?
