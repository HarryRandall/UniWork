1. Suppose that there were 25 people who had a reservation price of \$500, and the 26th person had a reservation price of \$200. What would the demand curve look like?

The demand curve would look like a horizontal line for the first 25 apartments at $500. Then there would be a sharp drop to $200 at the 26th person, and it would most likely continue to go down.

2. In the above example, what would the equilibrium price be if there were 24 apartments to rent? What if there were 26 apartments to rent? What if there were 25 apartments to rent?

a) 24 apartments = $500 equilibrium price
b) 26 apartments = $200 equilibrium price. After the 25th person, a single apartment would remain available, therefore the 26th person with a reservation price of $200 would determine the equilibrium price.
c) 25 apartments = $500 equilibrium price

3. If people have different reservation prices, why does the market demand curve slope down?

Because we start the market demand curve at the highest reservation price, slowly going down to different reservation prices. The line could be horizontal if everyone had the same reservation price.

4. In the text, we assumed that the condominium purchasers came from the inner-ring people—people who were already renting apartments. What would happen to the price of inner-ring apartments if all the condominium purchasers were outer-ring people—the people who were not currently renting apartments in the inner ring?

Inner-ring apartment prices stay the same because the demand for them hasn't changed.

---
5. Suppose now that the condominium purchasers were all inner-ring people, but that each condominium was constructed from two apartments. What would happen to the price of apartments?

The price of apartments would increase, as there is a decrease in supply, and therefore an increase in demand for the apartments.

6. What do you suppose the effect of a tax would be on the number of apartments that would be built in the long run?

There would be a decrease in profitability for landlords, as they have to pay extra tax. This would lead to a decrease in new construction and lower long-run supply of apartments.

7. Suppose the demand curve is \(D(p) = 100 - 2p\). What price would the monopolist set if he had 60 apartments? How many would he rent? What price would he set if he had 40 apartments? How many would he rent?

a) $100 - 2p = 60$
$2p = 100 - 60$
$2p = 40$
$p = 20$

So, if the monopolist has 60 apartments, they should set the price to $20 to rent all 60 apartments.

b) $100 - 2p = 40$
$2p = 100 - 40$
$2p = 60$
$p = 30$

Thus, if the monopolist has 40 apartments, they should set the price at $30 to rent all 40 apartments.

8. If our model of rent control allowed for unrestricted subletting, who would end up getting apartments in the inner circle? Would the outcome be Pareto efficient?

The renters with the highest willingness to spend (reservation price) would end up with the inner circle. This outcome would repeat until it was Pareto efficient.
