## The Market
##### 1.1 Constructing a model
 * Economics generally develops models based on social phenomena. 
 * An economic models attempts to describe every single aspect of reality.

Thought example:
* What determines the price of an apartment.
* Generally, we want to make the model as simple as possible.
* From there, we can add more complex features making it more realistic.
* We are thinking about apartments in a medium-size midwestern college town.
* There are two types of apartments
	1. Some adjacent to the university
		* These are generally more desirable by students as they are closer.
	2. Some further way from the university.
		* These are less desirable as they are further away
* The price of the outer ring of apartments is an exogenous variable.
* The price of the inner ring of apartments is an endogenous variable. 
* This means that the price of the outer-ring apartments is taken as determined by factors not discussed in this particular model, but the inner-ring apartments are.

* The first simplification that we will make is that **all** of the apartments are the same.

##### 1.1 Optimisation and Equilibrium
* ***The optimisation principle:** People try to chose the best patterns of consumption that they can afford.
	* This basically states, with no restrictions, people will choose the best option available to them.
* ***The equilibrium principle:** Prices adjust until the amount that people demand of something is equal to the amount that is supplied.
