1. Consider the production function $f(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 x_2^2$. Does this exhibit constant, increasing, or decreasing returns to scale?

2. Consider the production function $f(x_1, x_2) = 4x_1^{\frac{1}{2}} x_2^{\frac{1}{3}}$. Does this exhibit constant, increasing, or decreasing returns to scale?

3. The Cobb-Douglas production function is given by $f(x_1, x_2) = A x_1^a x_2^b$. It turns out that the type of returns to scale of this function will depend on the magnitude of $a + b$. Which values of $a + b$ will be associated with the different kinds of returns to scale?

4. The technical rate of substitution between factors $x_2$ and $x_1$ is $-4$. If you desire to produce the same amount of output but cut your use of $x_1$ by 3 units, how many more units of $x_2$ will you need?

5. True or false? If the law of diminishing marginal product did not hold, the worldâ€™s food supply could be grown in a flowerpot.

6. In a production process is it possible to have decreasing marginal product in an input and yet increasing returns to scale?
