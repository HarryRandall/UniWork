### Key Concepts on Monopoly and Natural Monopoly

1. **Monopoly Basics**:
   - A monopoly is when there’s only one firm in an industry.

   - A monopolist sets its price where **marginal revenue (MR)** equals **marginal cost (MC)** to maximise profits, leading to prices higher than in a competitive market.

   - This markup on the marginal cost depends on the **elasticity of demand** (how sensitive consumers are to price changes).

   - Monopolies typically produce less output than would be ideal for consumers and charge more, leading to **deadweight loss** (loss of overall economic efficiency).

2. **Natural Monopoly**:
   - Occurs when a firm has very high fixed costs (like setting up a power grid) but low marginal costs for serving additional customers.

   - Public utilities like gas, electricity, or water are often natural monopolies because it's costly to build infrastructure but cheap to add users.

   - **Example**: A gas company incurs huge costs to install pipes but can provide extra gas cheaply once pipes are in place.

3. **Regulating Natural Monopolies**:
   - If allowed to set prices freely, a natural monopoly could restrict output and charge high prices, creating **Pareto inefficiency** (a situation where resources aren’t allocated optimally).
   - Government regulation or operation of natural monopolies is common.
     - **Regulation**: Sets prices so that the monopoly can cover its costs (average cost pricing), usually resulting in a price-output level that covers costs without being fully efficient.
     - **Government Ownership**: Governments might directly operate some natural monopolies (e.g., public transport) and may subsidise them to cover costs and keep prices low.

### Why Monopolies Form

1. **Minimum Efficient Scale (MES)**:
   - If the **MES** (minimum level of output that minimises average cost) is large relative to market demand, only one firm can operate profitably.
   - Conversely, if MES is small, many firms can enter, leading to a competitive market.
   - **Example**: In small markets, only one airline may be viable, creating a monopoly, while in large markets, multiple airlines can compete.

2. **Market Conditions & Policy**:
   - Policies like **restrictive trade policies** (e.g., tariffs) can reduce market size and encourage monopolies by limiting competition.
   - Larger, open markets (e.g., global markets) promote competition by allowing multiple firms to enter.

3. **Cartels**:
   - Firms might collude (secretly agree) to limit output and raise prices, functioning as a cartel. This is illegal in many places.
   - **Example**: De Beers in the diamond industry controls the market through agreements with other producers, limiting diamond supply and influencing prices.

4. **First-Mover Advantage**:
   - When one firm enters a market first, it may build enough capacity to discourage new competitors by threatening to lower prices if they enter, thereby maintaining its monopoly.

### Examples of Monopolistic Practices

1. **De Beers Diamond Cartel**:
   - Controls diamond supply, pricing, and marketing to maintain high prices by limiting diamonds on the market.

2. **Auction Pools**:
   - Dealers collude to bid low in public auctions and hold private auctions among themselves, keeping prices low for initial sellers and splitting the profits afterward.

3. **DRAM Price Fixing**:
   - DRAM producers like Infineon conspired to set high prices for computer memory chips, leading to fines and legal penalties.

### Summary

1. When there is only a single firm in an industry, we say that it is a monopoly.
2. A monopolist operates at a point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Hence a monopolist charges a price that is a markup on marginal cost, where the size of the markup depends on the elasticity of demand.
3. Since a monopolist charges a price in excess of marginal cost, it will produce an inefficient amount of output. The size of the inefficiency can be measured by the deadweight loss—the net loss of consumers’ and the producer’s surplus.
4. A natural monopoly occurs when a firm cannot operate at an efficient level of output without losing money. Many public utilities are natural monopolies of this sort and are therefore regulated by the government.
5. Whether an industry is competitive or monopolized depends in part on the nature of technology. If the minimum efficient scale is large relative to demand, then the market is likely to be monopolized. But if the minimum efficient scale is small relative to demand, there is room for many firms in the industry, and there is a hope for a competitive market structure.


## Solving Math Problems
- Convert $D(p)$ into $Q$.
- $R$ revenue is found by $R = p \cdot Q$
- $MR$ is found by $\frac {\Delta R} {\Delta Q}$ it's the derivative of R
-  $MC$ is found by $\frac {\Delta c} {\Delta Q}$  it's the derivative of the cost function
- Optimal Output is when $MR = MC$ solving for $Q$
- Substitute $Q$ back into the original demand function.
