* Monotonicity 
	* y increases (weakly) with inputs
* Free disposal 
	* Excess inputs don't harm output.
* Convexity
	* (x<sub>1</sub>,x<sub>2</sub>), (z<sub>1</sub>,z<sub>2</sub>), both produce y
	* Weighted average can produce at least y
* Marginal Product
	* There is an analogy of marginal utility
	* We care about the actual output.
	* MP<sub>1</sub> (x<sub>1</sub>,x<sub>2</sub>) = $\Delta$y / $\Delta$x<sub>1</sub> = f(x<sub>1</sub>$\Delta$, x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>) - f(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>)
* Technical Rate of substitution (MRS UTILITY)
	* TRS (x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>) = $\Delta$x<sub>2</sub> / $\Delta$x<sub>1</sub> = 
* Diminishing TRS
	* x<sub>1</sub> $\uparrow$ unit, amount of x<sub>2</sub> $\downarrow$ declines
	* Short run (some fixed factors)
		* A coffee shop, the amount of chairs are fixed, machines are fixed etc.
		* You can't double the size of the coffee shops if theres a huge queue, or if you have lots of customers. Need to find the equilibrium.
		* You can't adjust the size to account for the short run demand.
	* Long run (all factors variable)
		* In the long run, you are able to extend the land, number of machines etc to account for demand.
	* What things are actually fixed or variable depends on the application (i.e coffee shop or Apple)
* Returns to scale
	*   CRS -> Constant returns to scale
		* Production can be scaled up directly in proportion to demand
	* t > 1 f(tx<sub>1</sub>,tx<sub>2</sub>) = tf(x<sub>1</sub>,x<sub>2</sub>) = ty 
	* All factors can be replicated
	* There's a limit in practice (the earth could not be replicated)
* Decrease Returns to Scale (DRS)
	* t > 1 : f(tx<sub>1</sub>,tx<sub>2</sub>) < tf(tx<sub>1</sub>,tx<sub>2</sub>)
	* There are some inputs that can't be replicated.
* Increasing Returns to Scale (IRS)
	* t > 1 : f($t$$x$<sub>1</sub>,$t$$x$<sub>2</sub>) > $tf$($t$$x$<sub>1</sub>,$t$$x$<sub>2</sub>)
	* Production of solar panels, China is the greatest manufacturer, Australia spent $1b subsidising Solar panels. Cannot compete.
	* How?
		* Learning by doing
		* Network effect
