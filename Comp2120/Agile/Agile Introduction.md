### Software Products
* Generic software systems that provide functionality that is useful to a range of customers.
* Many different types of products are available from large-scale business systems through personal products to simple phone apps and games.
* Software product engineering methods and techniques have evolved from software engineering techniques that support the development of one-off, custom software systems.
* Custom software systems are still important for large businesses, government and public bodies. They are developed in dedicated software projects.

#### Project-Based Software Engineering

* The starting point for the software development is a set of 'Software Requirements' that are owned by an external client and which set out what they want a software system to do to support their business processes.
* The software is developed by a software company (the contractor) who design and implements a system that delivers functionality to meet the requirements.
* The custom may change the requirements at any time in response to business changes (they usually do). The contractor must change the software to reflect these requirements changes.
* Custom software usually has a long-lifetime (10 years or more) and it must be supported over that lifetime.

### Product Software Engineering

* The starting point for product development is a business opportunity that is identified by individuals or a company. They develop a software product to take advantage of this opportunity and sell this to customers.
* The company who identified the opportunity will design and implement a set of software features that realise the opportunity and that will be useful to the customers.
* The software development company are responsible for deciding on the development timescale, what features to include and when the product should change.
* Rapid delivery of software products is essential to capture the market for that type of product. 

### Software Product Lines & Platforms
##### Software Product Line:
* A set of software products that share a common core. 
* Each member of the product line includes customer-specific adaptions and additions.
* Software product lines may be used to implement a custom system for a custom with specific needs that can't be met by a generic product.
##### Platform
* A software (or software + hardware) product that includes functionality so that  new applications can be built on it.
* An example of a platform is Facebook.
	* It provides an extensive set of product functionality but also provides support for creating 'Facebook apps'. These add new features that may be used by a business or a Facebook interest group.

### Software Execution Models
##### Stand-Alone
* The software executes entirely on the customer's computers.
##### Hybrid
* Part of the software's functionality is implemented on the customer's computer but some features are implemented on the product develop's server.
##### Software service
* All of the product's features are implemented on the develop's server and the customer accesses these through a browser or a mobile app.

### Comparable Software Development
The key feature of product development is that there is no external customer that generates requirements and pays for the software. This is also true for the other types of software development.

##### Student Projects
* Individuals or student groups develop software as part of their course.
* Given an assignment, they decide what features to include in the software.
##### Research software
* Researchers develop software to help them answer questions that are relevant to their research.
##### Internal tool development
* Software developers may develop tools to support their work.
* In essence, there are internal products that are not intended for customer release.

### The Product Vision
* The starting point for software product development is a 'product vision'.
* Product visions are simple statements that define the essence of the product to be developed.
* The product vision should answer three fundemental questions:
	1. What is the product to be developed?
	2. Who are the target customers and users?
	3. Why should customers buy this product?

### Moore's Vision Template
 - [ ] **For** (Target Customer) 
 - [ ] **Who** (Statement of the need or opportunity)
 - [ ] **The** (PRODUCT NAME) is a (product category)
 - [ ] **That** (key benefit, compelling reason to buy)
 - [ ] **Unlike** (primary competitive alternative)
 - [ ] **Our Product** (Statement of primary differentiation)
 
##### Example

FOR a mid-sized company's marketing and sales departments WHO need basic CRM functionality, THE CRM-Innovator is a Web-based service THAT provides sales tracking, lead generation, and sales representative support features that improve customer relationships at critical touch points. UNLIKE other services or package software products, OUR product provides very capable services at a moderate cost.

### Developing Product Vision
##### Domain Experience
* The product developers may work in a particular area (say marketing and sales) and understand the software support that they need. 
* They may be frustrated by the deficiencies in software they use and see opportunities for an improved system.
##### Product experience
- Users of existing software (such as word processing software) may see simpler and better ways of providing comparable functionality and propose a new system that implements this.
- New products can take advantage of recent technologic developments such as speech interfaces.
