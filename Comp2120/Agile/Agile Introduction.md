### Software Products
* Generic software systems that provide functionality that is useful to a range of customers.
* Many different types of products are available from large-scale business systems through personal products to simple phone apps and games.
* Software product engineering methods and techniques have evolved from software engineering techniques that support the development of one-off, custom software systems.
* Custom software systems are still important for large businesses, government and public bodies. They are developed in dedicated software projects.

#### Project-Based Software Engineering
 ![[Pasted image 20241022124059.png]]

* The starting point for the software development is a set of 'Software Requirements' that are owned by an external client and which set out what they want a software system to do to support their business processes.
* The software is developed by a software company (the contractor) who design and implements a system that delivers functionality to meet the requirements.
* The custom may change the requirements at any time in response to business changes (they usually do). The contractor must change the software to reflect these requirements changes.
* Custom software usually has a long-lifetime (10 years or more) and it must be supported over that lifetime.

### Product Software Engineering

![[Pasted image 20241022125552.png]]

* The starting point for product development is a business opportunity that is identified by individuals or a company. They develop a software product to take advantage of this opportunity and sell this to customers.
* The company who identified the opportunity will design and implement a set of software features that realise the opportunity and that will be useful to the customers.
* The software development company are responsible for deciding on the development timescale, what features to include and when the product should change.
* Rapid delivery of software products is essential to capture the market for that type of product.

### Software Product Lines & Platforms
##### Software Product Line:
* A set of software products that share a common core. 
* Each member of the product line includes customer-specific adaptions and additions.
* Software product lines may be used to implement a custom system for a custom with specific needs that can't be met by a generic product.
##### Platform
* A software (or software + hardware) product that includes functionality so that  new applications can be built on it.
* An example of a platform is Facebook.
	* It provides an extensive set of product functionality but also provides support for creating 'Facebook apps'. These add new features that may be used by a business or a Facebook interest group.

---
### Software Execution Models
##### Stand-Alone
* The software executes entirely on the customer's computers.
##### Hybrid
* Part of the software's functionality is implemented on the customer's computer but some features are implemented on the product develop's server.
##### Software service
* All of the product's features are implemented on the develop's server and the customer accesses these through a browser or a mobile app.

### Comparable Software Development
The key feature of product development is that there is no external customer that generates requirements and pays for the software. This is also true for the other types of software development.

##### Student Projects
* Individuals or student groups develop software as part of their course.
* Given an assignment, they decide what features to include in the software.
##### Research software
* Researchers develop software to help them answer questions that are relevant to their research.
##### Internal tool development
* Software developers may develop tools to support their work.
* In essence, there are internal products that are not intended for customer release.

---
### The Product Vision
* The starting point for software product development is a 'product vision'.
* Product visions are simple statements that define the essence of the product to be developed.
* The product vision should answer three fundamental questions:
	1. What is the product to be developed?
	2. Who are the target customers and users?
	3. Why should customers buy this product?

### Moore's Vision Template
 - [ ] **For** (Target Customer) 
 - [ ] **Who** (Statement of the need or opportunity)
 - [ ] **The** (PRODUCT NAME) is a (product category)
 - [ ] **That** (key benefit, compelling reason to buy)
 - [ ] **Unlike** (primary competitive alternative)
 - [ ] **Our Product** (Statement of primary differentiation)
 
##### Example

FOR a mid-sized company's marketing and sales departments WHO need basic CRM functionality, THE CRM-Innovator is a Web-based service THAT provides sales tracking, lead generation, and sales representative support features that improve customer relationships at critical touch points. UNLIKE other services or package software products, OUR product provides very capable services at a moderate cost.

##### Example Moore's Vision Template
- [ ] **For**: A mid-sized company's marketing and sales departments  
- [ ] **Who**: Need basic CRM functionality  
- [ ] **The**: CRM-Innovator is a web-based service  
- [ ] **That**: Provides sales tracking, lead generation, and sales representative support features that improve customer relationships at critical touch points

### Developing Product Vision
##### Domain Experience
* The product developers may work in a particular area (say marketing and sales) and understand the software support that they need. 
* They may be frustrated by the deficiencies in software they use and see opportunities for an improved system.
##### Product experience
- Users of existing software (such as word processing software) may see simpler and better ways of providing comparable functionality and propose a new system that implements this.
- New products can take advantage of recent technologic developments such as speech interfaces.
##### Customer Experience
- The Devs may have extensive discussions with prospective customers of the product to understand the problems that they face, constraints, such as interoperability, that limit their flexibility to buy new software, and the critical attributes of the software that they need.
##### Prototyping and playing around
- Developers may have an idea for software but need to develop a better understanding of that idea and what might be involved in developing it into a product.
- They may develop a prototype system as an experiment and 'play around' with ideas and variations using that prototype system as a platform.

---
### Software Product Management

- SDM is a business activity that focuses on the software products developed and sold by the business.
- Product managers (PMs) take overall responsibility for the product and are involved in planning, development and product marketing.
- PMs are the interface between the organisation, its customers and the software development team. They are involved at all stages of a product's lifetime from initial conception through to withdrawal of the product from the market.
- Product managers must look outward to customers and potential customers rather than focus on the software being developed. 

---
### Product Management Concerns

##### Business needs
- PMs have to ensure that current software being developed meets the business goals of the software development company.
##### Technology constraints
- PMs must make develops aware of technology issues that are important to customers.
##### Customer experience
- PMs should be in regular contact with current and potential customers to understand what they are looking for in a product, the types of users and their background and the ways that the product may be used.

---
### Technical Interactions of Product Managers
##### Product vision management
- The product manager may be responsible for helping with the development of the product vision.
- They should always be responsible for managing the vision, which involves assessing and evaluating the proposed changes against the product vision.
##### Product roadmap development
- A product roadmap is a plan for the development, release and marketing of the software. The PM should lead roadmap development and should be the ultimate authority in deciding if changes to the roadmap should be made.
##### User story and scenario development
- User stories and scenarios are used to refine a product vision and identify product features. Based on his or her knowledge of customers, the PM should lead the development of stories and scenarios.
##### Product backlog creation and management
- The product backlog is a prioritised 'to-do' list of what has to be developed. PMs should be involved in creating and refining the backlog and deciding on the priority of product features to be developed.
##### Acceptance testing
- Acceptance testing is the process of verifying that a software release meets the goals set out in the product roadmap and that the product is efficient and reliable.
- The PM should be involved in developing tests of the product features that reflect how customers use the product.
##### Customer testing
* Customer testing involves taking a release of a product to customers and getting feedback on the product's features, usability and business. 
* PMs are involved in selecting customers to be involved in the customer testing process and working with them during that process.
##### User interface design
* Product managers should understand user limitations and act as surrogate users in their interactions with the development team
* They should evaluate user interface features as they are developed to check that these features are not unnecessarily complex or force users to work in an unnatural way.

### Product Prototyping Concerns

##### Early Product Development
- Prototyping is essential for testing product ideas and showing market potential to both developers and funders.
##### User Engagement
- A working version of the product allows users to provide feedback, highlighting what they like or dislike and suggesting new features.
##### Technology Validation
- A prototype is useful for identifying essential software components and testing the underlying technology.
##### Security and Reliability
- Prototypes are typically discarded after development, with the final product built to address concerns like security and reliability.

---
### Two-Stage Prototyping Concerns
##### Feasibility Demonstration
- Develop an executable system to test if your ideas work and to show how your product can outperform competitors.
##### Customer Demonstration
- Extend the feasibility prototype with specific customer-focused features after conducting user studies to understand potential users and their needs.

### How to develop software?

1. Discuss the software that needs to be written
2. Write some code
3. Test the code to identify the defects
4. Debug to find causes of defects
5. Fix the defects
6. If not done, return to step 1

---

### Example of process decisions

* Writing down all requirements
* Require approval for all changes to requirements
* Use version control for all changes
* Track all reported bugs
* Review requirements and code
* Break down development into small tasks and schedule and monitor them
* Planning and conducting quality assurance
* Have daily status meetings
* Use Docker containers to push code between developers and OPS

---
### Milestones and deliverables
##### Milestones
* Making progress observable, especially for software
* Clear end point of a (sub)tasks
	* For project manager
	* Report, prototypes, completed subprojects
	* "80% done" not a suitable Milestone 
##### Deliverable
- Similar to Milestone, but for customers
- Reports, prototypes, completed subsystems

### Agile Software Engineering

- Software products must be brought to market quickly so rapid software development and delivery is essential.
- Virtually all software products are now developed using an agile approach.
- Agile software engineering focuses on delivering functionality quickly, responding to chaning product specifications and minimising development overheads.
- A larger number of 'agile methods' have been developed.
	- There is no best method
	- It depends on who is using the technique.

### Incremental development 
* All agile methods are based around incremental development and delivery.
* Product
