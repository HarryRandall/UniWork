### What Is DevOps 
- **DevOps** unifies development and operations to enhance software delivery speed and quality. 
- Benefits:
	- **Increased Velocity:** Faster product releases.
	- **Improved Quality:** Fewer bugs, more stability.
- Core principles: Automation of all repetitive tasks and shared responsibility across teams.
### CI: Continuous Integration 
- Continuous Integration (CI):Code changes are frequently integrated, built, and tested.
- Key Practices:
	- Commit often and test with each change to catch bugs early.
	- Avoid "breaking the build" by testing locally before pushing.
- Benefits: Faster bug detection, continuous feedback, and stable builds.
### CD: Continuous Deployment 
- Continuous Deployment (CD): Automatic release of validated builds to production.
- Benefits:
	- **Reduced risk** with smaller, frequent releases.
	- Faster **customer feedback** and ability to run A/B tests.
- Canary and Blue-Green Deployments: Staged releases to minimise user impact from potential issues.
### Infrastructure as Code 
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Manages and provisions infrastructure through code, ensuring consistency.
- Benefits:
	- **Visibility:** Configurations are documented and trackable.
	- **Reliability:** Reduces manual errors and enables environment reproducibility.
- Tools: Puppet, Ansible, and Terraform for automated, consistent deployment across servers.
### Monitoring
- **Monitoring and Observability:** Collects real-time data to track system performance and detect issues.
- Dashboards provide insights into:
	- **Normal vs abnormal behaviour** to enable faster problem-solving.
	- Correlating metrics with changes to identify cause and effect.
- Essential for understanding system health and preventing downtime.
