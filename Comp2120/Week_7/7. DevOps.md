### DevOps
* What is DevOps
Brings together two traditionally seperate groups within software organisations
	* Development, typically measured on features completed, code shipped
	* Operations, typically measured through stability, reliability, availability. 
**DevOps principles:**
1. Idea
2. Code
3. Build
4. Deploy
5. Manage
6. Learn

**DevOps Phases:**
1. Plan
2. Create
3. Verify
4. Package
5. Release
6. Configure
7. Monitor

**Uses Cases:**
* Optimise Core
* Unlock Legacy
* Unleash Digital

**Example (Netflix)**
* 100's of micro-services (features)
	* Search Feature
	* Server interactions
* 1,000's of production changes per day
	* The developers making changes
* 10,000's of Virtual Machines
* 100,000's of customer interactions per second
* 1,000,000's of ...

How do we get to DevOps?
Goals:
1. Technological: Automated process for moving code from dev to released
	1. Check-in
	2. Build
	3. Unit Test
	4. Build artifact
	5. Integration test
	6. Load test
2. Cultural, building cohesive, multidisciplinary teams
	1. Typically, develops are the "first responders" when things go bad in production.
	2. Sense of "ownership" by the develop all the way from inception to completion


* CI: Continuous Integration
	* Constant testing as code is checking-in/pushed to the repository (e.g., GH hooks)
	* Verify the build process works (i.e., parsing, compilation, code generation)
	* Verify unit test pass, style check pass, other static analysis tools
	* Build artifacts 
* CD: Continuous Deployment
	* Moving build artifacts from test -> stage -> production environments.
	* Gate code, if necessary, from advancing without manual approval. Useful when initially transition applications into a modern DevOps pipeline. 
* Infrastructure as Code
	1. Required resources (e.g. cloud services, access policies) are created by code
	2. No UI provisioning, no manual steps (avoid: easy to forget, time consuming)
	3. Immutable infrastructure, no update-in-place (SSH to server). Replace with new instances, decommission old instances.
	4. Nothing to produce without it being in code, checked-in, versioned along side code.
* Monitoring
	* Be able to know how your application is running in production
	* Track and analyse low-level metrics on performance, resource allocation.
	* Capture high-level metrics on application behaviour.
		* Whats "normal"?
		* What's "abnormal"?
