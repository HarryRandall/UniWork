### Overview
- Strong team culture emphasises trust, mutual respect, and collaborative goals.
- Encourages open communication and feedback, focusing on continuous improvement.
- Supports diverse perspectives, which enhance creativity and problem solving.
### 10X Engineers
- Highly productive engineers can deliver up to 10 times the output of an average developer.
- Performance factors include coding speed, debugging efficiency and program size.
- Often work independently and require minimal management but may need integration with team efforts.
### Teams and Team Issues
- **Social Loafing:** Some team members exert less effort in groups; mitigate by assigning clear roles and responsibilities.
- **Groupthink:** Suppression of dissenting views for harmony; prevent by promoting open discussions and diverse perspectives.
- **Multiple/Conflicting Goals:** Align team and individual goals to avoid clashes and maintain focus.
### Modern Team Structures
- **Feature Teams:** Small, cross-functional teams with members covering different aspects (e.g., design, testing).
- **Matrix Organisation:** Employees assigned to different projects temporarily; flexibility but may lear to role conflicts.
- **Autonomous Squads:** Teams with high autonomy but aligned with organisational goals, common in agile environments.
### Virtual Teams
- Virtual collaboration supported by tools (e.g., GitHub) **communication** and **engagement challenges**.
- Success requires **clear communication channels** and regular updates to maintain team cohesion and productivity.
### General Guidelines
- Foster an environment of **trust** and **strategic autonomy**.
- Reduce bureaucracy, promote peer coaching, and avoid in-team competition.
- Ensure realistic deadlines and protect time for quality assurance.
### Developer Turnover and Motivation
- **High turnover** leads to increased costs and productivity loss; mitigate by creating a positive culture with growth opportunities.
- Motivation theories stress the importance of addressing dissatisfaction while fostering autonomy, mastery, and purpose.
- Offering **learning opportunities**, flexible work conditions, and recognition helps retain talent. 
### Documentation
- Essential for code maintainability and team communication ; optimise for the reader.
- Types include reference docs, design docs, and tutorials.
- Documentation should be version-controlled, have clear ownership, and undergo regular reviews to stay updated.
