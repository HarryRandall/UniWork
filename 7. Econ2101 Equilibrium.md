#### Brief Coverage of Equilibrium

##### Supply
S (P) - How many units are supplied at price S

##### Market Equilibrium
Principle of optimisation
* Consumer - Each individual will choose their most desired goods based on income.
* Sum up individual demands to get market demand.

For supply, we would sum individual supply (firms supply) and we would get the market (MKT) supply.

##### Price Taking Assumptions
* In both cases of S&D, we assume the individual making up the S&D are very small relative to the market, making their impact minimal.
* Summation: Many small individuals take prices as given.

##### Equilibrium Price
* Competitive market: 
* D(p*) = S(p*)

###### Excess Supply
* p > p*
* D(p) < S(p)

###### Excess Demand
* p < p*
* D(p) > S(p)

###### Inverse S & D
* P<sub>s</sub>  (q) = Supply
* P<sub>d</sub> (q) = Demand

****** Comparative Statics
* Exogenous change, income(n) increases
	* Demand (D) shifts outwards
	* Tech breakthrough -> Supply (S) shifts outwards

#### Taxes
Seperate Price<sub>s</sub> and Price<sub>d</sub>
P<sub>d</sub> = P<sub>s</sub>  + t

##### Partial Equilibrium
The measure of D,S of a particular good (or set of goods).

##### General Equilibrium "GE"
We want to determine how D&S for all goods are determined and the equilibrium for the whole economy. 


#### The 2 x 2 GE model
* Two consumers
	* C<sub>a</sub>
	* C<sub>b</sub>
* Two Goods
Notes: Superscript = Good, Subscript = Person
	* G<sub>a</sub>: X<sub>a</sub> = ( X<sup>1</sup><sub>A</sub> ,  X<sup>2</sup><sub>A</sub> )
	* G<sub>b</sub>: X<sub>B</sub> = ( X<sup>1</sup><sub>B</sub> ,  X<sup>2</sup><sub>B</sub> )

Allocation =  X<sub>a</sub> , X<sub>B</sub> 


##### Initial Endowment
* Person A: ( W<sup>1</sup><sub>A</sub> ,  W<sup>2</sup><sub>A</sub> ) = W<sub>A</sub>
* Person B:  (W<sup>1</sup><sub>B</sub> ,  W<sup>2</sup><sub>B</sub> ) = W<sub>B</sub>

Trade -> Final allocation is ... ?

Note how income is determined
-> It's endogenous, part of the equilibrium
